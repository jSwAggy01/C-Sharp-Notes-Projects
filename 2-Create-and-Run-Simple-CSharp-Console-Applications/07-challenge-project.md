# Project Overview

The objective of this project was to update the **Student Grading Application** by implementing the requested features by the teacher by preserving the original code but also satisfying the user request in the best possible manner.

## Specifications

The feature implementations were as follows:
- **Part I**:
    - use the existing arrays and array values for all student grade calculations.
    - use the nested structure provided by the existing foreach and if statements.
    - declare and initialize any other integer variables that are required for calculating sums.
    - declare and initialize any other decimal variables that are required for calculations and/or score report values.
- **Part II**:
    - use the existing arrays and array values for all student grade calculations.
    - use the nested structure provided by the existing foreach and if statements.
    - calculate the sum of exam and extra credit assignment scores using variables from the first exercise or the original code.
    - calculate the average for exam scores and extra credit scores using variables from the first exercise or the original code.
    - calculate the final numeric score as follows: add 10% of the extra credit score sum to the exam score sum, and then divide that value by the number of exams.
    - calculate the extra credit points earned as follows: divide 10% of the extra credit score sum by the number of exams.

## Final Output

```
Student         Exam Score      Overall Grade   Extra Credit

Sophia          92.2            95.88   A       92 (3.68 pts)
Andrew          89.6            91.38   A-      89 (1.78 pts)
Emma            85.6            90.94   A-      89 (5.34 pts)
Logan           91.2            93.12   A       96 (1.92 pts)

## Conclusion

This project demonstrated fundamental software development principles such as:
- Translating user requests into applicable code
- Determining best implementation of application logic
- Avoiding significant redesigns
- Maintaining the functionality of the existing application
