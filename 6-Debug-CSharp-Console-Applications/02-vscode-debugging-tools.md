# Implement the Visual Studio Code debugging tools for C#

This section provided a comprehensive overview of the built-in debugging tools offered by **Visual Studio Code**. I learned how to set and configure breakpoints, navigate the **RUN AND DEBUG** interface, and utilize the **DEBUG MENU** to *step-through* and analyze the behavior of a program line-by-line in order to efficiently debug code.

Since the guide is very hands on, please see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/implement-visual-studio-code-debugging-tools/ for more details.

TLDR, in order to debug properly:
1. Set **BREAKPOINTS** at the suspected parts of your program.
2. Use the debug menu (top-center) to **STEP-THROUGH** and analyze your program, line-by-line.
3. Observe any undesired behavior.
4. Correct the errors.
