# Foundational C# with Microsoft - Notes and Projects

![](/other/csharp-certification-banner.png)

This repository contains documentation of all of the notes and projects I completed while pursuing my professional Foundational C# with Microsoft Developer Certification via [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn).

I've included the original section titles and descriptions within each sections `README.md` file; and for simplicity, I have summarized what that section covered in the *Topics Covered* area below. Subsequently, I've also included a *List of Projects* that house all of the guided and challenge projects that sometimes built off of each previous section/module.

## Topics Covered

1. [**<ins>Basics</ins>**](1-Write-Your-First-Code-Using-CSharp/readme.md) - literal and variable values, string formatting, arithmetic
2. [**<ins>Fundamentals</ins>**](2-Create-and-Run-Simple-CSharp-Console-Applications/readme.md) - methods, decision logic, arrays, loops, readable code
3. [**<ins>Logic</ins>**](3-Add-Logic-to-CSharp-Console-Applications/README.md) - booleans, code blocks, switch-cases, more loops
4. [**<ins>Variables</ins>**](4-Work-with-Variable-Data-in-CSharp-Console-Applications/README.md) - data types, conversion techniques, helper methods, formatting
5. [**<ins>Methods</ins>**](5-Create-Methods-in-CSharp-Console-Applications/README.md) - parameters, return values
6. [**<ins>Debugging</ins>**](6-Debug-CSharp-Console-Applications/README.md) - VSCode debugger, exception handling
